# Brainwave_Matrix_Intern_Task2
Credit Card Fraud Detection üöÄ

Overview

This project implements a Credit Card Fraud Detection System using Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. It utilizes a Random Forest Classifier and an Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection model to identify fraudulent transactions. The system is deployed using Flask and Ngrok for easy access.

Features

Random Forest Model for supervised fraud classification.

Autoencoder-based Anomaly Detection for unsupervised fraud detection.

Flask API for real-time fraud prediction.

Ngrok Integration to make the API publicly accessible.

Dataset

The project uses a dataset with credit card transactions, containing 30 numerical features derived from PCA transformation, including a Class label where:

0 ‚Üí Legitimate Transaction

1 ‚Üí Fraudulent Transaction

Tech Stack üõ†Ô∏è

Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, TensorFlow, Flask)

Machine Learning (Random Forest, StandardScaler)

Deep Learning (Autoencoder using TensorFlow/Keras)

Deployment (Flask, Ngrok)
